OH NO, I AM LATE!

Every morning, you wake up, and you need to get ready and grab your Baby to take them to Daycare. But oh no! You missed your alarm and now you only have 30 minutes to leave before you are late! With every room you pass, you lose more time. Additionally, there are items you need to secure for the daycare before you can leave; looking for them will take more time. You will need to fill the Baby Bag invetory with 6 items: Bottle, Diapers, Clothes, Pacifier, Car seat, and of course the baby!


'Oh no, I am late' about a text-based game where the player types their decisions through the console window. To win the game, players should take items from the rooms needed and reach outside.


You will start off in the Master Bedroom; with each movement where you will be moving either North, South, East or West between rules, you will lose one minute, this includes if you go the wrong direction or bump into a wall.

Additionally, you can search for an item that you need to add to your inventory. If you search you will lose one minute if you find an item. If you are unable to find an item, you will then lose 2 minutes. 

In harder versions of the game, once you grab the baby your time loss for moving and searching doubles. 

When you go outside by living the Entryway to the South, you have all 6 items in your inventory within the 30 minutes, then you win!
